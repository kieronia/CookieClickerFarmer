# CookieClickerFarmer

Basic cookie clicker script. Make sure to do the required pip installs, download chromedriver, specify the path on line 9 and have fun!
Create a text file named pause.txt to stop the clicking allowing you to make in game purchases etc.
Afraid once you close either 2 of the program/tab, to my belief, there is no way you can recover your data.

Although it doesn't have a scoreboard and seems to of made it easy for users to paste scripts into console,This is probably a violation of their tos - assume it is - I won't be responsible for actions etc - this is a demo - it is your choice and your responsibility for usage
